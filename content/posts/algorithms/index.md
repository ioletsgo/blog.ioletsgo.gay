I oftentimes hear phrases from boomers like `"Social Media is ROTTING Your Brain!"`, and, while they may not be able to explain the difference between a Pentium and a Ryzen, maybe they're not absolutely braindead in their assumptions.

I think it should come as no surprise when I make the following statement:

`* Our surroundings influence how we function in our day to day lives.`

Its a pretty surface level observation when you think about it. Our environment can greatly influence us, even with our genetics and what can be observed with our phenotype.

So I don't necessarily believe it would be hard to surmise that the same, or at least something very similar, can be said about our brain.
