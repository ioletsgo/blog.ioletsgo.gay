Despite my knowledge in computers, I've never been able to really sit myself down and learn programming. I'm not saying it was never out of me not trying.

I've always been fascinated by computers, some of my earliest memories involve loading an old Dell laptop with so many viruses it constituted as a threat to national security.

I don't want to give you the whole `"in 1981 the IBM Personal Computer was invented"` talk cause, while I think its important, I don't want to parrot the entire history of the personal computer, UNIX systems, DOS, etc etc.

If you want an interesting look into the history of computers, I would probably recommend [The Computer Chronicles](https://www.youtube.com/@ComputerChroniclesYT), beautifully archived on Youtube by Danooct1

How I see it, computers are relatively simple devices that are able to do a lot of complicated maths due to make interesting things happen. While I don't necessarily want to enter from the deep end using x86 Assembly off the bat, I'm an inquisitive mind and I have a tendency to ask a lot of questions that leads to `"Well, In x86 assembly..."`, which can be both annoying and demotivating if I don't have the necessary resources to ask and get answers for complicated questions.

`I don't want to be the type of person that doesn't understand why or how programming works`, which is why I made an unusual purchase of a programming textbook-- Particularly, the C++ Programming Language 4th Edition Hard Cover by Bjarne Stroustrup.

My intended goal is to be able to record my journey of using this resource, possibly in hopes to encourage others who are in a very similar position to me, the massive textbook being a constant physical reminder and motivator for me to learn.

Let's fucking learn I guess.
