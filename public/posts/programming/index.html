<p>Despite my knowledge in computers, I&rsquo;ve never been able to really sit myself down and learn programming. I&rsquo;m not saying it was never out of me not trying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by computers, some of my earliest memories involve loading an old Dell laptop with so many viruses it constituted as a threat to national security.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to give you the whole <code>&quot;in 1981 the IBM Personal Computer was invented&quot;</code> talk cause, while I think its important, I don&rsquo;t want to parrot the entire history of the personal computer, UNIX systems, DOS, etc etc.</p>
<p>If you want an interesting look into the history of computers, I would probably recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ComputerChroniclesYT">The Computer Chronicles</a>, beautifully archived on Youtube by Danooct1</p>
<p>How I see it, computers are relatively simple devices that are able to do a lot of complicated maths due to make interesting things happen. While I don&rsquo;t necessarily want to enter from the deep end using x86 Assembly off the bat, I&rsquo;m an inquisitive mind and I have a tendency to ask a lot of questions that leads to <code>&quot;Well, In x86 assembly...&quot;</code>, which can be both annoying and demotivating if I don&rsquo;t have the necessary resources to ask and get answers for complicated questions.</p>
<p><code>I don't want to be the type of person that doesn't understand why or how programming works</code>, which is why I made an unusual purchase of a programming textbook&ndash; Particularly, the C++ Programming Language 4th Edition Hard Cover by Bjarne Stroustrup.</p>
<h3 id="the-cover-of-the-c-programming-language-fourth-edition-textbookpostsprogrammingcppbookjpg"><img src="/posts/programming/CPPBook.jpg" alt="The cover of the C++ Programming Language Fourth Edition Textbook"></h3>
<p>My intended goal is to be able to record my journey of using this resource, possibly in hopes to encourage others who are in a very similar position to me, the massive textbook being a constant physical reminder and motivator for me to learn.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s fucking learn I guess.</p>
