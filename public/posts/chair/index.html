  <h1>Chairs and Creating the best environment for you</h1>

<p>I recently got a new chair, and it made me start to think about ergonomics a lot more.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/chair/jackfrostchair.jpg" alt="Picture of a jack frost plushy sitting on a new office chair"><img src="/posts/chair/oldchair.jpg" alt="Picture of an particularly simple chair, that being the old chair">
Overall, it&rsquo;s great. The mesh back allows for a lot of airflow, there&rsquo;s fantastic back support, and there&rsquo;s also retractable armrests.</p>
<p>For something that I got on deal for $30, I think it was more than a good bargain, especially compared to the Wish Chair From Hell that costs around the same.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s only one type of chair I think would be worse&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="/posts/chair/gamingchair.jpeg" alt="Picture of a chair marketed towards Gamers"></p>
<h2 id="gaming-chairs-are-not-good">Gaming chairs are NOT good!</h2>
<p>(and here&rsquo;s why)</p>
<p>Gaming chairs, because they take direct inspiration off of racing car seats, or bucket seats, they are designed to preserve a human in the case of a crash.
They are designed to protect against large and sudden G-Forces, not for comfort or even for ergonomics.</p>
<p>Bucket seats are designed so that you would tense up, especially around your shoulders, when mixed with the chest breathing technique, which a lot of people don&rsquo;t even know is a terrible way to breath, means that you are making yourself more and more uncomfortable just by sitting on a chair.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/chair/breathing-diagram.png" alt="Diagram of proper and improper breathing technique, chairs that take inspiration from bucket seats encourage improper breathing techniques at the benefit of preserving life in high G-force enviroments"></p>
<h2 id="ergonomics-vs-comfort-a-battle-of-frenemies">Ergonomics VS Comfort, A Battle of Frenemies</h2>
<p>Truth is, I have a ridiculously small desk.
It&rsquo;s dimentions are 31x18.5 inches, and sans an elevated platform at the back, there really isn&rsquo;t anything special about this desk, however what&rsquo;s creativity without restrictions?</p>
<p><img src="deske1.jpg" alt="Picture of a blank desk with a deskmat, lamp, and mouse"><img src="/posts/chair/deske2.jpg" alt="An overview of a blank desk with a deskmat, lamp, and mouse">
With a deskmat, Mechanical Keyboard, some games, maybe a plushy or two, a CD Player, and a bunch of other bits and bops, it really does start to feel like home.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/chair/desk.jpg" alt="Picture of a desk full of sentimental materials with a laptop pearched ontop of an elevated section in the back"></p>
<p>Notice the large space between the mouse and the keyboard. This was intenionally done to prevent Carpal Tunnel, through minimizing as many intersections my arms have to deal with on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The position of my laptop is a deliberate choice, as to prevent neckpain. Proper office ergonomics states that you shouldn&rsquo;t have to move your head down to look at your screen.</p>

<p>The elevated platform is simply a convienent alternative to the advised laptop stand in the diagram above</p>
<p>I find that comfort isn&rsquo;t just a physical state, but a mental state as well. If you&rsquo;re comfortable both physically and mentally, you will overall perform better at any task that you set yourself out to complete.</p>
