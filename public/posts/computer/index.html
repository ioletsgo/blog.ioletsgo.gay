  <h1>Laptop Nerd Builds Her First Computer</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never had my own personal desktop, which may be surprising for those who know me as a tech nerd.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve read my previous blog post about <a href="https://blog.ioletsgo.gay/posts/chair/">Chairs, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, and my acute obsession with ergonomics</a>, You probably noticed the fact that, despite being a tech nerd, I&rsquo;ve never had a full tower PC. You can see this as a continuation of that previous blogpost, as a whole load of stuff has changed since then. Honestly I don&rsquo;t know where to start&hellip;
So I guess we start where we last left off, with the Desk and what I&rsquo;ve done with it.</p>
<h2 id="audio">Audio</h2>
<h3 id="a-picture-of-my-desk-with-a-bunch-of-audio-equipment-like-a-microphone-midi-keyboard-and-an-audio-interfacepostscomputermusic1png"><img src="/posts/computer/music1.png" alt="A picture of my desk, with a bunch of audio equipment like a microphone, midi keyboard, and an audio interface"></h3>
<p>Since the last time I&rsquo;ve posted I&rsquo;ve completely overhauled my audio setup. You may not have been able to tell, but in the original setup, I had a Behringer U-Phoria UM2 audio interface that started to get really static-y in the XLR port, almost to the point where the microphone became unusable.</p>
<h3 id="a-picture-of-a-behringer-u-phoria-um2postscomputerimage_be_p0avv_um2_front_xlpng"><img src="/posts/computer/Image_BE_P0AVV_UM2_Front_XL.png" alt="A picture of a Behringer U-Phoria UM2"></h3>
<p>After believing that its the microphone (and breaking it, I guess that&rsquo;s a project for a later date. <a href="https://blog.ioletsgo.gay/index.xml#feed">If that sounds like fun, please subscribe to the RSS feed</a>), I had to replace my mic (that I bought Used) with a brand new AT2020, and a BluCoil 48 V Portable USB Audio Interface</p>
<h3 id="a-picture-of-a-blucoil-48-v-portable-usb-audio-interfacepostscomputerblucoil-portable-usb-audio-interfacewebp"><img src="/posts/computer/Blucoil-Portable-USB-Audio-Interface.webp" alt="A picture of a BluCoil 48 V Portable USB Audio Interface"></h3>
<p>Part of my reasoning for choosing this audio interface was the fact that I wanted something that worked, but also had knobs on the front (My autistic brain absolutely loves physical dials and analog audio controls. Also they look really cool.)</p>
<p>The headphones I daily drive are the Audio Technica ATH-M50xBT2, costing around 170 dollars on sale. I can highly recommend these headphones for a multitude of reasons, with the battery being an easy sell and the mobile app being a change of pace compared to similar high end devices that makes you feel like you need it to get the least out of your devices.</p>

<p>The entire purpose of this build was Flexibility. I never, at any point, wanted to feel like I was held back by my hardware choices. If I, say, wanted to make Youtube Videos, I&rsquo;m totally capable of doing that with this audio setup. If I wanted to make music, I have my Midi Keyboard, I have my myriad of musical instruments, and you&rsquo;d better believe I&rsquo;ll be busting some tunes.</p>
<h2 id="the-actual-computer">The Actual Computer</h2>
<p>You probably didn&rsquo;t click on this blog post for audio nerd shit. You clicked on this blog for some old fashioned computer nerd shit. Well, I&rsquo;m proud to announce that I&rsquo;ll be able satisfy that need.</p>

<h3 id="a-picture-of-the-zalman-z3-iceberg-computer-casepostscomputerz3-icebergpng"><img src="/posts/computer/Z3-Iceberg.png" alt="A picture of the Zalman Z3 Iceberg Computer Case"></h3>
<p>Using a Zalman Iceberg computer case, it ensures that this AMD-based system gets plenty of air, creating the best possible environment for my Linux system to operate, and for a cheap price too.
I built her over the span of 3 months, with the best end-of-the-line AM4 hardware possible.</p>
<h3 id="a-pc-part-picker-list-showing-a-high-end-computer-fully-paid-for-going-slightly-over-1600-usdpostscomputerpcpartpickerpng"><img src="/posts/computer/pcpartpicker.png" alt="A PC part picker list showing a high end computer fully paid for going slightly over 1,600 USD"></h3>
<p>She can run basically any software I toss at it. With 32 gigs of ram she&rsquo;s an absolute beast that only the highest end of AAA games with absolutely abysmal optimizations could dream of filling, all while running at a low 40C and only going to high 50Cs under heavy loads.</p>
<p>My first time building a computer was definitely&hellip; Interesting. It wasn&rsquo;t until I basically had the entire thing built that I had to use my background in tech support to deduce that I got a faulty motherboard (I went all-in on the fact that the computer booted ONCE with no stability issues, even under heavy CPU, GPU, and RAM loads. If anything crashed while it was booted I knew that it was something else.), so I had to get a replacement. While I was swapping all of the components, I accidentally bent one of the pins on my CPU. Just my luck. Luckily I have small steady hands so I was able to bend the pins back with relative ease.
I was too busy focusing on fixing shit that I didn&rsquo;t even think to document it.
Building a computer was definitely a unique experience, multiple points did i lose motivation and almost give up, but I knew that it would all be worth it.</p>
<p>Porting the original blogpost to the new blog, I&rsquo;ve been using this desktop for over 4 months, and its been going really smooth. I haven&rsquo;t had any real trouble with it and its given me a lot of freedom to do stuff I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do. Honestly, I&rsquo;d heavily recommend building a computer for anybody who is interested in it.</p>
