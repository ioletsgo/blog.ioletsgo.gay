      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-banner-of-a-jack-frost-plushy-sitting-on-a-new-office-chairpostschairbannerpng&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ioletsgo.gay/posts/chair/banner.png&#34; alt=&#34;A banner of a jack frost plushy sitting on a new office chair&#34;&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently got a new chair, and it made me start to think about ergonomics a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ioletsgo.gay/posts/chair/jackfrostchair.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Picture of a jack frost plushy sitting on a new office chair&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ioletsgo.gay/posts/chair/oldchair.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Picture of an particularly simple chair, that being the old chair&#34;&gt;
Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s great. The mesh back allows for a lot of airflow, there&amp;rsquo;s fantastic back support, and there&amp;rsquo;s also retractable armrests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For something that I got on deal for $30, I think it was more than a good bargain, especially compared to the Wish Chair From Hell that costs around the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there&amp;rsquo;s only one type of chair I think would be worse&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ioletsgo.gay/posts/chair/gamingchair.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Picture of a chair marketed towards Gamers&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gaming-chairs-are-not-good&#34;&gt;Gaming chairs are NOT good!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(and here&amp;rsquo;s why)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming chairs, because they take direct inspiration off of racing car seats, or bucket seats, they are designed to preserve a human in the case of a crash.
They are designed to protect against large and sudden G-Forces, not for comfort or even for ergonomics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bucket seats are designed so that you would tense up, especially around your shoulders, when mixed with the chest breathing technique, which a lot of people don&amp;rsquo;t even know is a terrible way to breath, means that you are making yourself more and more uncomfortable just by sitting on a chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ioletsgo.gay/posts/chair/breathing-diagram.png&#34; alt=&#34;Diagram of proper and improper breathing technique, chairs that take inspiration from bucket seats encourage improper breathing techniques at the benefit of preserving life in high G-force enviroments&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ergonomics-vs-comfort-a-battle-of-frenemies&#34;&gt;Ergonomics VS Comfort, A Battle of Frenemies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth is, I have a ridiculously small desk.
It&amp;rsquo;s dimentions are 31x18.5 inches, and sans an elevated platform at the back, there really isn&amp;rsquo;t anything special about this desk, however what&amp;rsquo;s creativity without restrictions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;deske1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Picture of a blank desk with a deskmat, lamp, and mouse&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ioletsgo.gay/posts/chair/deske2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;An overview of a blank desk with a deskmat, lamp, and mouse&#34;&gt;
With a deskmat, Mechanical Keyboard, some games, maybe a plushy or two, a CD Player, and a bunch of other bits and bops, it really does start to feel like home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ioletsgo.gay/posts/chair/desk.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Picture of a desk full of sentimental materials with a laptop pearched ontop of an elevated section in the back&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the large space between the mouse and the keyboard. This was intenionally done to prevent Carpal Tunnel, through minimizing as many intersections my arms have to deal with on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The position of my laptop is a deliberate choice, as to prevent neckpain. Proper office ergonomics states that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to move your head down to look at your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.gvsu.edu/cms4/asset/30F6D8A1-9140-75C7-2CAACF4A83B9D5A8/monitor_angle%5B1427479542%5D.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A diagram showing proper laptop/monitor placement to encourage the best posture&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elevated platform is simply a convienent alternative to the advised laptop stand in the diagram above&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that comfort isn&amp;rsquo;t just a physical state, but a mental state as well. If you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable both physically and mentally, you will overall perform better at any task that you set yourself out to complete.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
